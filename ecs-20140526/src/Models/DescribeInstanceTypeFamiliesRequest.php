     *
     *   ecs-1: Series I, which consists of the earliest and cost-effective instance types
     *   ecs-2: Series II, which provides upgraded software and hardware and higher performance than Series I
     *   ecs-3: Series III, which consists of high-performance instance families and is suitable for different business scenarios
     *   ecs-4: Series IV, which consists of enterprise-level instance families (such as g5, c5, and r5), ECS Bare Metal Instance families (such as ebmc5s, ebmg5s, and ebmr5s), and burstable instance families (such as t5) and can meet a wide variety of business requirements with lower latency
     *   ecs-5: Series V, which consists of enterprise-level instance families (such as g6, c6, and r6), ECS Bare Metal Instance families (such as ebmg6, ebmg6e, and ebmc6), and storage-enhanced instance families (such as g6e) and delivers quick response times and higher performance
     *   ecs-6: Series VI, which consists of enterprise-level instance families (such as hfc7, hfg7, and hfr7) and ECS Bare Metal Instance families (such as ebmhfg7)
