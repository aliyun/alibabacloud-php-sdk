     *   **DIRECT**: An exchange of this type routes a message to the queue whose binding key is exactly the same as the routing key of the message.
     *   **TOPIC**: This type of exchange is similar to direct exchanges. An exchange of this type routes a message to one or more queues based on the results of the fuzzy match or multi-condition match between the routing key of the message and the binding keys of the current exchange.
     *   **FANOUT**: An exchange of this type routes all received messages to all queues bound to this exchange. You can use a fanout exchange to broadcast messages.
     *   **HEADERS**: This type of exchange is similar to direct exchanges. The only difference is that a headers exchange routes messages based on the headers attributes instead of routing keys. When you bind a headers exchange to a queue, you must configure binding attributes in the key-value format for the binding. When you send a message to a headers exchange, you must configure the headers attributes in the key-value format for the message. After a headers exchange receives a message, the exchange routes the message based on the matching results between the headers attributes of the message and the binding attributes of the bound queues.
     *   **X-CONSISTENT-HASH**: An exchange of this type allows you to perform hash calculations on routing keys or header values and use consistent hashing to route a message to different queues.
     *
     * This parameter is required.
